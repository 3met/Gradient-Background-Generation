# Gradient-Background-Generation
 
## Description
This project contains a blender file with a script to generate images of gradients made with cubes. Many images that I have generated can be found in the `generated` folder. The script can be found in the blender file to generate more images.

The purpose of this project was to create several images to use as the wallpaper on my laptop. I have set Windows to change my wallpaper every 5 minutes to a different gradient image from a folder of 150 images.

## Examples
The follow are examples contained in the `examples` folder.

Using my favourite settings:
